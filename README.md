- Runtime configuration updates with automatic persistence

**Smart Caching with Intelligence**
- LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction strategy
- Time-to-live (TTL) expiration for stale entries
- Memory pressure monitoring (Chrome only)
- Automatic cache pruning when memory usage > 80%
- Detailed cache statistics and hit/miss ratios

**Performance Telemetry**
- Uses PerformanceObserver API for efficient metrics collection
- Tracks cache performance, image rewrites, script deferrals, and observer count
- Minimal CPU overhead using idle callbacks
- Session uptime and real-time diagnostics

**Safety & Stability**
- Observer limiting to prevent performance degradation
- Defensive programming with try-catch boundaries

- Debounced and throttled operations
- Safe DOM element waiting with timeouts

### Advanced Speed Optimizations

**Preconnect**
- Analyzes page resources and establishes early connections to external domains
- Reduces DNS, TCP, and TLS handshake time for external resources
- Prioritizes top 10 most-used external origins

**Critical Resource Preloading**
- Preloads first 3 CSS files for faster style application
- Preloads visible images (above the fold) for instant rendering
- Uses `<link rel="preload">` for browser priority hints

**Font Optimization**
- Automatically adds `font-display: swap` to prevent FOIT
- Optimizes Google Fonts URLs with display parameter
- Preconnects to font CDNs for faster font loading

**Aggressive Script Deferral**
- Uses `requestIdleCallback` to defer non-critical scripts
- Automatically defers analytics, tracking, and social media scripts
- Ensures critical scripts run first for faster interactivity

**Reflow Reduction**
- Batches DOM reads and writes using `requestAnimationFrame`
- Applies CSS containment to media elements
- Exposes `window.webPerfBatch` API for manual batching
- Uses `content-visibility` for off-screen content

### Core Optimizations

**Hardware Acceleration**
Applies CSS transforms (`translateZ(0)`, `translate3d`) to media elements and animated components, forcing GPU rendering for smoother performance.

**DNS Prefetching**
Injects `<link rel="dns-prefetch">` tags for:
- Common CDNs (Google, Cloudflare, jsDelivr, etc.)
- External domains referenced on the page
- Font services, analytics, and social media platforms

**Smart Caching (Enhanced v6.0)**
- Stores fetched resources as Blob URLs in memory
- Uses LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction strategy
- TTL-based expiration (1 hour default)
- Memory pressure monitoring and adaptive cache pruning
- Automatically prunes cache when size limit is exceeded
- Tracks hit/miss ratios and eviction metrics for diagnostics

**Image Optimization**
- Intercepts image loads using debounced MutationObserver
- Rewrites URLs to request WebP format
- Falls back to original format if WebP unavailable
- Serves from cache when possible

**Adaptive FPS**
- Throttles `requestAnimationFrame` based on visibility
- Reduces to 12 FPS when tab is in background
- Returns to 60 FPS when tab becomes active
- Saves CPU/battery on idle tabs

## 📊 Performance Impact

Expected improvements on typical websites with v5.5:
- **30-60% faster** initial page load (up from 20-40%)
- **40-60% reduction** in bandwidth usage (up from 30-50%)
- **20-35% better** frame rate consistency (up from 15-25%)
- **15-30% lower** CPU usage on idle tabs (up from 10-20%)
- **50-70% faster** font rendering (FOIT eliminated)
- **25-40% reduction** in layout shifts (reflow optimization)

*Results vary based on website structure and content. Improvements are most noticeable on content-heavy sites.*

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Script not working in Tampermonkey?
- **Check installation**: Open Tampermonkey dashboard and verify the script is listed and enabled
- **Check permissions**: Ensure the script has "Always allow" or appropriate domain permissions
- **Reload the page**: After installation or enabling, refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
- **Check console**: Press F12 and look for green "[WebPerf]" messages in the console
- **Try manual trigger**: If initialization fails, reload the page once more

### Script not working in other managers?
- Ensure your userscript manager is enabled
- Check that the script is enabled in the manager
- Reload the page after installation
- Some features may require specific GM grants - Tampermonkey is recommended

### Website looks broken?
- Some sites may conflict with hardware acceleration
- **v6.0 Fix**: Use the new domain blacklist feature via menu: "⚙️ Disable on this domain"
- **Quick fix**: Click the userscript manager icon → Toggle features individually
- Try disabling `hardwareAccel` or `imageRewriter` individually
- You can exclude specific sites in Tampermonkey's settings

### Performance worse instead of better?
- Very lightweight sites may see overhead from the script
- **v6.0 Feature**: Use "⚙️ Disable on this domain" to blacklist permanently
- **Tampermonkey tip**: Right-click the icon → "Disable on this site"
- Adjust `maxObservers` if you see high CPU usage
- Adjust cache size if memory is constrained

### Menu commands not showing?
- This is normal for some userscript managers (not a Tampermonkey issue)
- The script will still work with default settings
- All features are enabled by default

### High memory usage?
- **v6.0 Feature**: Automatic memory pressure monitoring
- Cache automatically prunes when system memory > 80%
- Reduce `cacheSizeLimitMB` in configuration
- TTL ensures stale entries are removed after 1 hour

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- **No data collection**: Everything runs locally in your browser
- **No external requests**: Only prefetches resources from pages you visit
- **Minimal telemetry**: Performance metrics collected locally (can be disabled)
- **Open source**: Inspect the code yourself
- **Per-domain control**: Blacklist/whitelist for fine-grained control
